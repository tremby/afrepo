This is where repositories go.

In a repository directory (which can have any name) there should be a PHP file 
extending the AFRepo class named *AFRepo.class.php, where * is anything. The 
class should be named the same way: *AFRepo in this case.

A sample layout for a repository called "salami":

salami
 |- audio -- symlinks to audio files and their fingerprints
 |   |- 00
 |   |   |- abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567
 |   |   |- abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567.en.json
 |   |   |- bcdef0123456789abcdef012345678
 |   |   `- bcdef0123456789abcdef012345678.en.json
 |   `- 01
 |       |- cdef0123456789abcdef0123456789
 |       |- cdef0123456789abcdef0123456789.en.json
 |       |- def0123456789abcdef0123456789a
 |       `- def0123456789abcdef0123456789a.en.json
 |- fp-vs-db.salami.log -- fingerprinter log
 |- lists -- lists of filenames describing the various subsets
 |   |- subset1
 |   `- subset2
 |- SalamiAFRepo.class.php -- the extended AFRepo class
 |- salami_metadata.csv -- a support file holding the audiofiles' metadata
 `- stats -- some statistics about the repository output from the stats script
     |- subset1.stats
     `- subset2.stats
